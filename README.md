Monty-Hall
==========

Another educational exercise to understand the Monty Hall Problem, written in Java. I also intend to re-write this in C# given the similarities.

For those interested, I get an average of 0.67 probability when the user switches their choice, and 0.34 when they don't.

==========
To run the code, it takes two arguments from the CLI; the first being a number of iterations, and the second a binary value as to whether the user would switch or not (1 being switch, 0 not).
